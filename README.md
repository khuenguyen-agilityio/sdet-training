# Java Training

Java is a versatile programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s. Renowned for its portability, reliability, and ability to run on various platforms, Java is commonly used for web development, mobile applications (Android), desktop applications, and large-scale systems. Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy simplifies the development and maintenance processes by allowing code to be written once and run on different platforms.
